Project status
--------------

[Version changelog](https://github.com/TES3MP/openmw-tes3mp/blob/master/tes3mp-changelog.md)

As of version 0.7.0, TES3MP is fully playable, providing very extensive player, NPC, world and quest synchronization, as well as state saving and loading, all of which are highly customizable via [serverside Lua scripts](https://github.com/TES3MP/CoreScripts).

Remaining gameplay problems mostly relate to AI and the synchronization of clientside script variables.

Donations
---------------

You can benefit the project by donating on Patreon to our two developers, [David Cernat](https://www.patreon.com/davidcernat) and [Koncord](https://www.patreon.com/Koncord), as well as by supporting [OpenMW](https://openmw.org).

Contributing
---------------

Helping us with documentation, bug hunting and video showcases is always greatly appreciated.

For code contributions, it's best to start out with modestly sized fixes and features and work your way up. There are so many different possible implementations of more major features – many of which would cause undesirable code or vision conflicts with OpenMW – that those should be talked over in advance with the existing developers before effort is spent on them.

Feel free to contact the [team members](https://github.com/TES3MP/openmw-tes3mp/blob/master/tes3mp-credits.md) for any questions you might have.
